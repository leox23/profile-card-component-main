## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I had problems to fully stretch the background of the user image, for no method from CSS I could, so I knew and change the width of the SVG from the file itself, which can be done directly from CSS if the correct properties are used:
```html
<svg width="978" height="978" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">...
```

In the HTML you can use a special "invisible" character in order to add more space to a word specifically, instead of using the CSS letter-spacing as in the example of the image:
```html
	  ‚Üì
<span>‚†Ä26</span>
```

In CSS for properties with several blocks of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are separated by comma, you can place one below one for better readability:
```css
body{
    ...
    background: url(images/bg-pattern-top.svg) -740px -640px no-repeat,
                url(images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg) 118px 270px no-repeat,
                #19A1AD;
}
```

Using the CSS BEM methodology, you have to be careful with the name of the classes, it will make elements that interfere with class names do not show correctly:

```Css
.child-container {
    ... some rules ...
}
/*=========================*/
.social-container { üö´‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå
    üö´The Container class is repeated, an
    unnoticed error, and is not showed correctly.
}

.social {‚úÖ
    ‚úÖ Better solution
}

```

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Excellent tool for fast CSS queries in case of doubts.
- [Css Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This specific site I like to support me in the complete articles of [Flex-Box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid).
- [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) - Great software that I use in my day by day, in this case, use the rule, the color picker and the magnifying glass.
