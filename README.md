## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There are things that I could solve on the road and that they were necessary to replicate the challenge as the same as possible:

I had problems to fully stretch the background of the user image, for no method from CSS I could, so I knew and change the width of the SVG from the file itself, which can be done directly from CSS if the correct properties are used:
```html
<svg width="978" height="978" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">...
```

In the HTML you can use a special "invisible" character in order to add more separation space to a word specifically, instead of using the CSS letter-spacing as in the example of the image:
```html
      ‚Üì
<span>‚†Ä26</span>
```

In CSS for properties with several blocks of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are separated by comma, you can place one below one for better readability:
```css
body{
    ...
    background: url(images/bg-pattern-top.svg) -740px -640px no-repeat,
                url(images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg) 118px 270px no-repeat,
                #19A1AD;
}
```

Using the CSS BEM methodology, we have to be careful with the name of the classes, it will make elements that interfere with class names do not show correctly:

```Css
.child-container {
    ... some rules ...
}
/*=========================*/
.social-container { üö´‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå
    üö´The Container class is repeated, an
    unnoticed error, and is not showed correctly.
}

.social {‚úÖ
    ‚úÖ Better solution
}

```

### Continued development

Specifically, my future goal for the kind of skills in this challenge, is to be able to use Flex-box and CSS Grid in larger and more complex page layouts, and to be faster at debugging CSS in general, **just because it's not a programming language, doesn't mean it's not complex.**

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Excellent tool for fast CSS queries in case of doubts.
- [Css Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This specific site I like to support me in the complete articles of [Flex-Box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid).
- [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) - Great software that I use in my day by day, in this case, use the rule, the color picker and the magnifying glass.
