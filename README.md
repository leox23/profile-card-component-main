## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There are things that I could solve on the road and that they were necessary to replicate the challenge as the same as possible:

I had problems to fully stretch the background of the user image, for no method from CSS I could, so I knew and change the width of the SVG from the file itself, which can be done directly from CSS if the correct properties are used:
```html
<svg width="978" height="978" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">...
```

In the HTML you can use a special "invisible" character in order to add more separation space to a word specifically, instead of using the CSS letter-spacing as in the example of the image:
```html
	  ‚Üì
<span>‚†Ä26</span>
```

In CSS for properties with several blocks of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are separated by comma, you can place one below one for better readability:
```css
body{
    ...
    background: url(images/bg-pattern-top.svg) -740px -640px no-repeat,
                url(images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg) 118px 270px no-repeat,
                #19A1AD;
}
```

Using the CSS BEM methodology, we have to be careful with the name of the classes, it will make elements that interfere with class names do not show correctly:

```Css
.child-container {
    ... some rules ...
}
/*=========================*/
.social-container { üö´‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå
    üö´The Container class is repeated, an
    unnoticed error, and is not showed correctly.
}

.social {‚úÖ
    ‚úÖ Better solution
}

```

### Continued development

Specifically, my future goal for the kind of skills in this challenge, is to be able to use Flexbox and Css Grid in larger and more complex page layouts, and to be faster at debugging CSS in general, **just because it's not a programming language, doesn't mean it's not complex.**

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Excellent tool for fast CSS queries in case of doubts.
- [Css Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This specific site I like to support me in the complete articles of [Flex-Box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid).
- [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) - Great software that I use in my day by day, in this case, use the rule, the color picker and the magnifying glass.
